    Upcoming Improvements

        Freeze Entity Column: We’ll be freezing the entity column in the second section, allowing it to remain visible while scrolling horizontally. This will improve usability when working with extensive data tables.

        New Columns: We’ll add two additional columns in the second section:
            One column to indicate whether the entity is still flagged following any updates made in the table.
            Another column to provide related status updates, giving a clearer view of entity states after editing.

        Vertically Oriented Column Headers: Based on feedback, we’ll adjust the headers to be slightly vertical for better readability and to maximize space.

        Hide Column Feature: A new feature will allow users to hide specific columns, making it easier to focus on relevant data as needed.

Thank you all for your input and engagement. These enhancements should address many of the usability points raised, and I’ll keep you posted on our progress.

Best regards,
