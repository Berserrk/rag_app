"The classification is working properly overall, with a couple of exceptions regarding location entities like 'EU' and 'UK'. These are being labeled as location entities because the description indicates that EU-based companies are involved in the criminal activities being discussed.
We now have two options to consider:

Remove location from the labeling entirely, if we determine that classifying these broad regional descriptors as locations is not providing meaningful insights.
Continue labeling locations, but only when a specific place is directly mentioned as the site of criminal activity, rather than general regional references.

I recommend we discuss these two approaches and decide which option will provide the most accurate and useful classification for our needs. Please let me know your thoughts on the best path forward."
