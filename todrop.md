"Hello everyone,
Today I'm excited to introduce a new initiative called 'Who are we? - It's up to you!' This is a community-driven project within GCRG & GOTO AI focused on continuous learning in data and AI.
Let me start by sharing our vision. This community is being built on a powerful principle: 'By the people, for the people.' We believe that the best learning happens when we come together to share our diverse knowledge and experiences.
We're fortunate to have four exceptional Initial Coordinators leading this effort:

Andrew Todd, who brings extensive experience as our GOTO Initiative Manager, with a background in data science and is currently pursuing his MSc
Anna Porubova, a GCRG GOTO Data Scientist working on MyPolicies
Firat Erman from M&M
And Andrew McPherson, who brings expertise in Data Strategy

But here's what makes this initiative truly special - it's not just about the coordinators. We're actively seeking volunteers who can bring their unique knowledge, expertise, and most importantly, their energy and passion to this community. If you have insights to share or simply the enthusiasm to learn and contribute, we want you on board! We're planning to hold fortnightly sessions to ensure steady progress and engagement across both GCRG & Tech teams, spanning all locations.
As for who can participate as learners - the answer is simple: anyone across GCRG & GCRG GOTO who has an interest in growing their knowledge in AI and data. There are no barriers to entry - just bring your curiosity and willingness to learn.
The success of this community will ultimately depend on all of us. So I invite each of you to consider how you might contribute to and benefit from this learning journey. Whether you're an expert looking to share your knowledge or someone eager to learn, there's a place for you here.
